#  Review For Swifty-Marvel
I did this project as a review for another project, Swifty-Marvel located on github: https://github.com/Mohanedy98/swifty-marvel

This project has an associated blog post on my blog at Medium which explains everything in greater detail.

This sample project will not run without first following the instructions to set up ArkanaKeys. I followed the instructions provided and had to fiddle around with everything a bit to get it actually running (maybe 30 mins set up if you are interested).
