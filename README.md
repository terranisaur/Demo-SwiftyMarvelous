I did this project as a review for another project, Swifty-Marvel located on github: https://github.com/Mohanedy98/swifty-marvel
Big thanks to Mohaned for the inspiration!

This sample project will not run without first following the instructions to set up ArkanaKeys. I followed the instructions provided and had to fiddle around with everything a bit to get it actually running (maybe 30 mins set up if you are interested).
